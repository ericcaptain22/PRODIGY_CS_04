## Introduction
Recording the keys struck on a keyboard, commonly referred to as keystroke logging or keyboard capturing, is typically a covert action that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. This type of surveillance has the capability to record every keystroke made on that system.

Keystroke logging can be acheived with the help of a keylogger, short for keystroke logger, that allows the person operating the program to capture every keystroke that the user makes and then retreive that data.

### Prerequisite
This project assumes you have Python 3 already installed on both your machine and the target's to run the keylogger. If not, go ahead and [download the latest version for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) from the official Python Software Foundation.
